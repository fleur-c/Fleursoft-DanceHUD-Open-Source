Hi!

This is a set of the sources for the Fleursoft DanceHUD
Open Source version.

The Fleursoft DanceHUD is a heads up display object for use in
secondlife (copyright, trademark and whatever) and in OpenSim
(copyright, trademark and whatever) that tries very hard to
make dancing in SL and OpenSim easy and fun.

There are LOTS of parts to this DanceHUD... the website (http://fleursoft.com) has all of the documentation.

There is a commercial version of the dancehud that includes
a couple more features (transfer and easy updates) and more
immediate support for helping when there are problems...
otherwise the two of the dancehuds are pretty much identical.

The open source one just happens to cost nothing and is a
full permission object - you can see/modify everything in it.

The commercial one has a couple of scripts that are 'no modify'
and 'no transfer' - as that is how to restrict access to the
special extra features.
